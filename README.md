Hi, I’m Anssi. Welcome to my GitHub page!

Here you can find some of my random unfinished projects which I have started in order to learn something new or just for fun. 
Sometimes I even get back to them but usually new ideas just keep popping up.

Currently I'm most interested in Python and C/C++. Actually C has been my favorite language for ages but I've recently found out that C++ has some really nifty
features too. Python on the other hand is really quick to implement and try things out. With type hints etc you can make the code look really nice too.
Static typing is the way to go.
